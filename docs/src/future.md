# Improvements

## Optimisation
The performance of Oolong has not been tested with real-world examples. Hence
it has also not been optimised.

## Features
[//]: # (TODO: link to GitHub)
Multiple features could be added to the language. A conclusive list is the
GitHub repository.

## Compilation in Julia
Whether compilation could be done in Julia, and how well that would work, is
still an open question.
