# Improvements

## Optimisation
The performance of Oolong has not been tested with real-world examples. Hence
it has also not been optimised.

## Features
Multiple features could be added to the language. These are documented in the [issues](https://github.com/oolongtensor/oolong/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement).

## Compilation in Julia
Whether compilation could be done in Julia, and how well that would work, is
still an open question.
